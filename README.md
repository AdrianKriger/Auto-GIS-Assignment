Assignment: Accessibility
========================

This project has changed its scope. In the spirit of *"la Ville des proximit√©s"* it will attempt to understand how accessisible the City of Cape Town is to those who walk and cycle. Accessisibility will be measured at 15 minutes walking and 15 minutes cycling.

### Data

 - The data will mostly come from local South African sources:
 
    - [City of Cape Town](https://www.capetown.gov.za)
    - [Statistics South Africa (StatsSA)](http://www.statssa.gov.za)
    - [Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)](https://www.csir.co.za)
    - [Open Street Map[(https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page7)

### The tool will attempt to understand how accessible the City is:

- Population distribution and demographics

    - Key statistics with graphs
    
   
- Population growth

    - Compare population from at least two different years *(with a possible projection)*.
    - Visualize as graphs
    

- Accessibility:

     - Travel Times/Distance will focus on accessibility to employment and amenities [parks, schools, resturants, etc].
     - Visualization through graphs and maps
     
  ### Hopefully if everything falls into place a "walk-score" type metric for each suburb can be calculated.
