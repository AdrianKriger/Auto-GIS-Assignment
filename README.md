Assignment: Accessibility
========================

This project has changed its scope. In the spirit of *"la Ville des proximit√©s"* it will attempt to understand how accessible the City of Cape Town is to those who walk and cycle. Accessibility will be measured at 15 minutes walking and 15 minutes cycling. ~ as more interesting data becomes available the content of this repository will change.
